		<!--About text-->
		<p class="aboutText">
		Thank you for visiting Brew The Best! The company was formed in January of 2013 by Julian Dodge, a drop out college student that had an extreme passion for coffee. Without having a source of income, Julian decided to make a internet site to sell all of his coffee goods in hopes of earning enough to pay his landlord next months rent. Surprisingly, all of Julians items were sold within a day yielding him a very large profit. Because of the instant success, Julian decided to form the company and continue selling coffee. Ever since, Brew The Best has been growing every day hiring new employees, investing in new coffee making techniques and finding the most flavorful roast. Now competing with top notch coffee companies such as Starbucks and Tullys, Brew The Best is one of Americas leading producers and distributors for coffee goods!
